The data folder contains the National Register of Historic Places raw dataset in .xlsx and .csv file formats. This dataset has information on properties added to the National Register from its inception in 1966 through June 17, 2021. The original spreadsheet was downloaded in .xlsx file format from the National Park Service website (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/data-downloads.htm) in October 2021, and was converted into .csv format for future accessibility. The raw dataset contains 96,644 rows and 21 columns.

Column Notes:
**Area of Significance** indicates why a property is included on the National Register.

**Category of Property** classifies listed properties as one of five broad types: building, district, object, site, or structure.

**Status** appears as “listed” for all properties because the dataset contains only properties currently on the National Register as of 06/17/2021, not properties that were once included but have been delisted or demolished. In the raw dataset, there are seven empty columns between the External Link and Status fields.
