\f0\fs24 \cf0 The docs folder contains all material written in relation to the project. The methodology statement discusses my use of quantitative analysis, while the analysis statement details the techniques I used to analyze and visualize my dataset. These documents, as well as the enclosed data management plan, were created as part of earlier project check-ins. Additionally, there is a codebook with metadata about my datasets, which I hope will prove useful for reproducibility. Lastly, the folder contains my deliverables for the final project: a report and a poster. All documents have been saved in .pdf format. }
