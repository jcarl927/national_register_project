The src folder contains a .py file with the source code used on the National Register Processed Dataset. This Python script creates four separate counters that count the properties by state, category, area of significance, and year listed on the National Register. The script then writes the dictionaries produced by these counters to four separate .csv files, which are saved in the results folder.
